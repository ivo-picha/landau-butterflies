# calculates the spectrum of a system of a set number of Landau levels (NLL+1)
# in a square cosine periodic potential of given strength U0 [eV] and lattice constant a [m]
# for a given rational magnetic flux per unit cell phi = p/q

# arguments can include options for outputting plots and/or data files,
# calculating eigenstates, electronic densities, band calculating dispersions, ....
